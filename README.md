# WebPack template

## Run project build
The address of your project on the PC should not be Cyrillic. Ideally - create from the root of the C: or D: folder "projects" and place in it the folder of your project. You might have something like this: C: \ projects \ my-project

1. Cloning a project to your PC               
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AnatoliyNBulyga/yogaWebPack
```

2. Go to the created folder
```sh
cd yogaWebPack 
```

3. Install all dependencies
```sh 
npm install
```
4. To run the build
```sh 
npx webpack
```
